/**
 * A factory for Accessibles on rectangular neighborhoods.

 * This specific factory differs to {@link RectangleShape} in that it allows
 * non-isotropic rectangular shapes. However, it constrains the the neighborhood
 * to be symmetric by its origin.
 * <p>
 * The size of the neighborhood is specified by an <code>int[]</code> span
 * array, so that in every dimension <code>d</code>, the extent of the
 * neighborhood is given by <code>2 × span[d] + 1</code>.
 * <p>
 * This factory exists because {@link RectangleShape} which is based on the same
 * components, only allows for square neighborhoods.
