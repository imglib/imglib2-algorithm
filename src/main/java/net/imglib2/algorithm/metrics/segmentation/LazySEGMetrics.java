/**
 * The LazySEGMetrics computes a running {@link SEGMetrics} over all images added by calling
 * {@link #addTimePoint(ImgLabeling, ImgLabeling) addTimePoint}. The images are expected to be
 * of dimension XYZ, where Z can be of depth 1.
 * <p>
 * The score is computed by accumulating the number of ground-truth labels and their corresponding
 * IoU with respect to matching prediction labels. Each contribution is computed by adding images
 * using {@link #addTimePoint(ImgLabeling, ImgLabeling) addTimePoint}. The final score can be queried by {@link #computeScore()}.
 * <p>
 * Each image's contribution is calculated independently. Therefore, the same LazYSEGMetrics object
 * can be called from multiple threads in order to speed up computation. For instance, if the
 * total stack does not fit in memory, lazy loading and multithreading can be used to compute the
 * SEG score by splitting the XYZ images between threads and adding them one by one. The final score
 * can then be calculated once all threads have finished.
